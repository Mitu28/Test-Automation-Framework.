Test Automation Framework
This Java-based Test Automation Framework is designed for web application testing.

It supports data-driven testing, cloud execution, and headless mode for efficient test execution.

The framework integrates LambdaTest for cloud testing, Maven Surefire Plugin for CLI-based execution, Extent Reports for reporting, and Log4j for logging.

Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

Java 11 (Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly)

Maven (For dependency management and test execution)

Download Link: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Git (To clone the repository)

Chrome/Firefox browser (Required for local execution)

Features
Java 11-based testing framework.

Selenium WebDriver for UI automation.

TestNG for test execution and assertions.

Data-driven testing using OpenCSV, Gson, and Apache POI (supports CSV, JSON, and Excel).

Fake data generation using the Faker library.

Cloud execution via LambdaTest (for cross-browser testing).

Headless mode for faster test execution.

Maven Surefire Plugin for CLI-based execution with custom parameters.

Logging using Log4j (logs stored in the log folder).

Reports generated using Extent Report(reports.html)

Installation
Clone the repository using Git:

 git clone https://github.com/Mitu28/Test-Automation-Framework..git
 cd Test-Automation-Framework
 Running Tests on LambdaTest Cloud

mvn  test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode

mvn  test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X
Reporting & Logs
After test execution:

Extent Report Path: ./report.html

Open it in a browser to view detailed test execution results.

Log4j Logs
Path: log/

Stores execution logs to help debug failures.

Integrated the project with Github actions
This automation framework is integrated with github actions The test will be executed at 11:30 pm IST every single day.

The reprts will be archived in gh-pages. You can view the html reports at https://github.com/Mitu28/Test-Automation-Framework/report.html
