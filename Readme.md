# Test Automation Framework

This Java-based Test Automation Framework is designed for web application testing.

 It supports data-driven testing, cloud execution, and headless mode for efficient test execution. 
 
 The framework integrates LambdaTest for cloud testing, Maven Surefire Plugin for CLI-based execution, Extent Reports for reporting, and Log4j for logging.


## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 11** (Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly)

- **Maven** (For dependency management and test execution)

- Download Link: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

- Git (To clone the repository)

- Chrome/Firefox browser (Required for local execution)


## Features
- **Java 11**-based testing framework.

- **Selenium WebDriver** for UI automation.

- **TestNG** for test execution and assertions.

- **Data-driven testing** using OpenCSV, Gson, and Apache POI (supports CSV, JSON, and Excel).

- **Fake data** generation using the **Faker library**.

- Cloud execution via **LambdaTest (for cross-browser testing)**.

- **Headless mode** for faster test execution.

- **Maven Surefire Plugin** for CLI-based execution with custom parameters.

- Logging using **Log4j** (logs stored in the log folder).

- Reports generated using **Extent Report**(reports.html)

## Installation

**Clone the repository using Git:**

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Mitu28/Test-Automation-Framework..git
 cd Test-Automation-Framework
```
    

**Running Tests on LambdaTest Cloud**

```bash
mvn  test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X

```
    
 **Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode**

```bash
mvn  test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X

```

## Reporting & Logs
After test execution:

Extent Report
Path: ./report.html

Open it in a browser to view detailed test execution results.

## Log4j Logs
Path: log/

Stores execution logs to help debug failures.


## Integrated the project with Github actions
This automation framework is integrated with github actions
The test will be executed at 11:30 pm IST every single day.

The reprts will be archived in gh-pages.
